Part 1. Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding


1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table;

Example;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_attributes_count
FROM attribute;


Results:

+------------------------+
| total_attributes_count |
+------------------------+
|                  10000 |
+------------------------+

i. Attribute table = 1000
ii. Business table = 1000
iii. Category table = 1000
iv. Checkin table = 1000
v. elite_years table = 1000
vi. friend table = 1000 
vii. hours table = 1000
viii. photo table = 1000
ix. review table = 1000 
x. tip table =  1000
xi. user table = 1000



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
FROM table;

Example;


SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)) AS id_count
FROM business;


i. Business =       id: 10000
ii. Hours =         business_id: 1562
iii. Category =     business_id: 2643
iv. Attribute =     business_id: 1115
v. Review =         id: 10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id: 493
vii. Photo =        id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii. Tip =         user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id: 2780


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."
